# Project: BattleShip

### Group Member Names: Adam Etzion, Alex Osborne, Liam Cusack

#### Goals and Expectations for the Project (What does each group member hope to get out of this project? What do we want to achieve as a team? How will we know that we're successful?):
 **Goals and Expectation**
  * Having each individual understand the code is more important than getting a 4, or even a 3
  * Passing score
  * Confidence in branching and working with git/github within a team
  * Work as a team, not individually (e.g., assign driver-others)
  * Alway post zoom links, even if not able to join

  **How will we know we are successful?**
  * Regular touchpoints / check-ins where we look back at goals / expectations
  * Keeping each other accountable
  * Catching people up if they fall behind
  * COMMUNICATING EFFECTIVELY

#### Team strengths & collaboration styles (consider discussing your Pairin qualities here):

 **Styles**
 * Take breaks, work-life balance leads to better work
 * Adam is a morning person
 * Need break after class before meeting as a group
 * Avoid coding/working past 9pm (as needed), unless IN THE GROOVE!

#### How we can use our strengths to overcome obstacles:
  * Communicate as adults
  *


#### Schedule Expectations (When are we available to work together and individually? What constraints do we have? Make sure to discuss the remote questions above in regards to this section):
* COPY PASTE


#### Communication Expectations (How and often will we communicate? How do we keep lines of communication open? How will we make decisions as a team? How will we communicate about our emotional and mental well-being with each other?):
* Same as turing response expectations
   * Check your slack before class in the AM
   * Be responsive during class hours (normal daytime)
* Be direct with your feedback

#### Abilities & Growth Expectations (Technical strengths and areas for desired improvement):
**Abilities or Growth Expectations**
  * Confidence with github, merging, push/pull
  * Make clean code (convention)
  * Making sure no man is left behind

#### Workload Expectations (What features do we each want to work on?):
  * Be present for all coding (as able)
  * Alternate driver and pulls/commits

#### Workflow Expectations (Git workflow/Tools/Code Review/Reviewing Pull Requests/Debugging and Problem-solving Techniques):
* Hope to review after girhub flow class
* When there is a disagreement, vote! We have three people. Try both, make your case and then vote.

#### Pomodoro Break Schedule:
* Take at least 5 minutes every 50 minutes; larger breaks for when we are truly stuck


#### Expectations for giving and receiving feedback:
* Don't hold things in - be direct but respectful
* Ask questions! But if completely not related parking lot them.
* Give feedback!

#### Additional Remote Considerations:**
  * Keep things remote this time!
  * Maybe a celebratory beer when we reach the finish line

#### Project management tools we will use (GitHub projects or Trello are popular tools):
  * Trello
  * Github

#### Day 1 Agenda:
  * Meet 5-7 pm (TUESDAY), go later as needed
  * Alex to check-in with Mentor
  * Read through iteration 1 at least before meeting

#### Additional Notes:
  * n/a
